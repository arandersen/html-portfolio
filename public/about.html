  <p>Hello! I'm Arthur, a senior Computer Science student at UCSD with a passion for software development and a strong commitment to leveraging technology for positive impact. My journey in computer science is driven by a curiosity for learning and an eagerness to apply my skills in real-world situations.</p>
    
  <p>I'm currently gearing up to graduate in June 2024, proudly holding a GPA of 3.55. My academic path has been rich with relevant coursework in data structures, algorithm design, software engineering, and databases, preparing me well for the challenges and opportunities in the tech industry.</p>

  <p>My technical toolkit is diverse, ranging from version control systems like Git and SVN to web development frameworks such as React.js. I'm proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, R, and SQL, which allows me to adapt and thrive in various development environments.</p>

  <p>My experience spans from front-end development for the Loloma Foundation, where I've been instrumental in designing user-friendly UI/UX for electronic medical records, to developing an AI chatbot for menopause education with Menolearn. These roles have sharpened my skills in creating intuitive and impactful technology solutions.</p>

  <p>At Edmonds College, I served as an IT support specialist, honing my troubleshooting skills and technical knowledge. Alongside my studies and professional experiences, I've engaged in meaningful projects like PantryPal, a full-stack web application for recipe management and recommendations, showcasing my ability to blend AI with web development.</p>

  <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I'm actively involved in community service through organizations like PERMIAS and the Indonesia Catholic Youth Organization, contributing to technology development and leading event organization.</p>

  <p>I'm enthusiastic about the future and eager to contribute to a dynamic team where I can continue to grow, innovate, and make a meaningful impact. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate!</p>
